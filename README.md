## Media files specifications
For most images a size ratio of 1:1 or 16:9 is better to display the images nicely in the website. Images shouldn't be bigger than 1600 pixels.

### Using GIMP
To scale images always lock the proportions of the image and use NoHalo as the **Interpolation** algorithm.

To export the images, in most cases, JPEG (.jpg) is the most convenient format. Use a **Quality** between `70` and `100` and in the **Advanced options** menu select a `4:2:2` **Sampling**

### Gen photos
